# Embedded Fonts

The following fonts are embedded into `piet-cosmic-text` as a fallback for when
loading fails:

- DejaVu Sans
- DejaVu Serif
- DejaVu Sans Mono

In this directory, you can find the distributed version of these fonts. Aside
from removing some `fontconfig` files, this is the same as the distribution from
the DejaVu team, licensing and all.
